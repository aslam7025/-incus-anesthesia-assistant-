 
# Incus – Voice-Controlled Anesthesia Hardware Controller

Incus is an educational prototype that demonstrates a **voice-controlled anesthesia workstation interface** using Python-based speech recognition and an ESP8266 microcontroller.

The system allows spoken commands to control simulated medical hardware actions over WiFi, with real-time feedback and safety-oriented interaction.
